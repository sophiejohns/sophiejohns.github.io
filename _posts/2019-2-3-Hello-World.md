title: Creating a website
---

Hello - this is my first blog post. I'll be posting about fun data projects I do or techniques that I find interesting. 

To begin I thought I'd explain how I created this website. I am running it through [my GitHub account](https://github.com/sophiejohns). GitHub is an open source development platform. It's great tool for version control - so you don't have various 'project-final-FINAL-actualfinal.ipynb' files on your computer. It is also a place to share and develop code collaboratively. This website is a perfect example of how code can be shared.  

I used the pre-existing website template called Jekyll which can be found [here](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on barryclark's GitHub account. It comes with a default website that looks like this:

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/jekyll-default.png)  

I 'Fork'-ed the Jekyll code which creates a copy of barryclark's code on my own GitHub account. I then change the code to customise my own website. For information on setting up a GitHub website you can check out [this page](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/) and for more information on using Jekyll you can go [here](https://x-team.com/blog/build-a-free-website-with-jekyll-and-github-pages/). 


### Jekyll and Hyde

I suspect Jekyll was named from the 1886 book 'Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde' by Robert Stevenson. It is a tail of a London legal practitioner who investigates strange circumstances surrounding his friend, Henry Jekyll. In the novel Jekyll takes a potion to try and hide the evil within, a person named Hyde. I love the parallel between the 'good' and clean version of a website which could be considered Jekyll versus the often complicated back end which is the Hyde. By the end of the novel Jekyll relies on Hyde just as a nice website relies on the more complicated back end.
