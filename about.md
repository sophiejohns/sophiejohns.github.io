Hi! I am guessing you're here to find out more about me. You can find my technical experience below but first I thought I'd give you an idea of who I am. 

In my spare time I enjoy playing Ultimate Frisbee. The aspect I love most about the sport is that there are no referees. This means that at all levels players must calmly communicate and resolve an on-field disputes. Playing allows me to work within a team towards a common goal while maintaining good spirit. I have found that effective collaboration starts by assuming the best in everyone otherwise you're already starting on the back foot.    

Modelling disease spread is another passion of mine. I discovered epidemiology in my undergraduate degree and have been expanding my knowledge ever since. I have developed disease multiple models including one on Tasmanian Devil facial tumour disease. I am amazed that such complex systems can be represented by a few elegant equations.
